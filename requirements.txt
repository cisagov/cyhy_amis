# With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
# identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
# OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
# Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
# 2.10 or newer.
#
# We need at least version 6 to correctly identify Amazon Linux 2023
# as using the dnf package manager, and version 8 is currently the
# oldest supported version.
#
# We have tested against version 9.  We want to avoid automatically
# jumping to another major version without testing, since there are
# often breaking changes across major versions.  This is the reason
# for the upper bound.
#
# Note that this dependency should be kept in sync with the version
# pin found in the requirements-test.txt file in
# cisagov/skeleton-ansible-role.

# ansible-core 2.16.3 through 2.16.6 suffer from the bug discussed in
# ansible/ansible#82702, which breaks any symlinked files in vars,
# tasks, etc. for any Ansible role installed via ansible-galaxy.
# Hence we never want to install those versions.
