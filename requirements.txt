# With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
# identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
# OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
# Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
# 2.10 or newer.
#
# We need at least version 6 to correctly identify Amazon Linux 2023
# as using the dnf package manager, and version 8 is currently the
# oldest supported version.
#
# We have tested against version 9.  We want to avoid automatically
# jumping to another major version without testing, since there are
# often breaking changes across major versions.  This is the reason
# for the upper bound.
