  - .github
kinds:
  # This will force our systemd specific molecule configurations to be treated
  # as plain yaml files by ansible-lint. This mirrors the default kind
  # configuration in ansible-lint for molecule configurations:
  # yaml: "**/molecule/*/{base,molecule}.{yaml,yml}"
  - yaml: "**/molecule/*/molecule-{no,with}-systemd.yml"
# These roles are defined in this repository but are not available in the paths
# available by default to Ansible and Ansible-lint. I was unable to find a way
# to append to this list instead of completely overwriting it and overwriting
# will only generate additional problems given the structure of this
# repository and the fact that Ansible configurations are in multiple sub-
# directories.
