  # Useful checks that one must opt-into.  See here for more details:

  # This exclusion is implicit, unless exclude_paths is defined
  - .cache
  # Seems wise to ignore this too
  - .github
kinds:
  # This will force our systemd specific molecule configurations to be treated
  # as plain yaml files by ansible-lint. This mirrors the default kind
  # configuration in ansible-lint for molecule configurations:
  # yaml: "**/molecule/*/{base,molecule}.{yaml,yml}"
  - yaml: "**/molecule/*/molecule-{no,with}-systemd.yml"
# These roles are defined in this repository, do not overlap with existing
# cisagov/ansible-role-* roles, and are not available in the paths available by
# default to Ansible and Ansible-lint. I was unable to find a way to append to
# this list instead of completely overwriting it and overwriting will only
# generate additional problems given the structure of this repository and the
# fact that Ansible configurations are in multiple sub-directories.
