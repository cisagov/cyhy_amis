## Building the AMIs ##

The AMIs are built like so:

```console
cd packer
ansible-galaxy install --role-file ansible/requirements.yml
packer init .
packer build .
```

If building a non-default image (for testing as an example) the prefix for the
created AMI can be changed from the default value of `cyhy` like so:

```console
packer build -var ami_prefix=testing -only amazon-ebs.bastion .
```

You can also use a `.pkrvars.hcl` file to set any variables.  For example:

```hcl
ami_prefix = "testing"
```

Also note that

```console
ansible-galaxy install --force --role-file ansible/requirements.yml
```

will update the roles that are being pulled from external sources.  This
may be required, for example, if a role that is being pulled from a
GitHub repository has been updated and you want the new changes.  By
default `ansible-galaxy install` *will not* upgrade roles.

## Building the Terraform-based infrastructure ##

The Terraform-based infrastructure is built like so:

```console
ansible-galaxy install --role-file ansible/requirements.yml
cd terraform
terraform workspace select <your_workspace>
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=<your_workspace>.tfvars
```

Again, in some cases you may find it useful to add the `--force` flag
to the `ansible-galaxy` command.

## Tearing down the Terraform-based infrastructure ##

The Terraform-based infrastructure is torn down like so:

```console
cd terraform
terraform workspace select <your_workspace>
terraform init
terraform destroy -var-file=<your_workspace>.tfvars
```
